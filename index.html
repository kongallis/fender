          Often copied, but never surpassed, the Stratocaster is arguably the
          world’s most-loved electric guitar. Electrifying the music world since
          its debut in 1954, its natural, versatile sound made the Stratocaster
          the benchmark for exceptional guitar tones. The American Professional
          Stratocaster isn’t a re-imagining of the classic design; it’s the
          authentic original model, evolved. This limited-edition model comes
          with a lightweight ash body in Antique Natural with a Tortoiseshell
          pickguard.

        <p class="productDetails">
          A period of change, both for Fender and for American culture as a
          whole, the 1960s saw the Strat mellow as it grew up. The white
          pickguard was updated to mint green, and the fingerboard was switched
          from the original maple to rosewood, adding a smoother note to the
          Strat's clear, articulate voice. The American Original '60s
          Stratocaster keeps these refinements intact while adding modern feel
          and pickup switching to the iconic instrument that helped birth guitar
          rock as we know it.
